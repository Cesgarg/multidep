Description: Easily computes non-parametric estimators of several multivariate extensions of Spearman's rho based on the concept of orthant dependence. The package offers the possibility to compute the rank-based estimators of the multivariate Spearman coefficients of average lower and upper orthant dependence introduced by Nelsen (1996), as proposed by Pérez and Prieto-Alaiz (2016). It also allows to calculate the non-parametric estimators of the tie-corrected versions of the coefficients, as proposed by Genest et al. (2013).
